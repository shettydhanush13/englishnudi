The course content was very rich and designed in accordance with the day-to-day needs of the workplace. My teacher was one-of-a-kind. She was an enthusiastic person with a strong stimulus for students’ needs. She was extremely well organised and tailored her teaching in accordance with her students’ needs. She helped me a lot and I made big progress. The course has really made a difference and has boosted my language skills and confidence.”</p>
